# ProjectMachina

Project Machina is a small city simulation filled with NPCs that you can chat with. These NPCs will be built with large language models and reinforcment learning. The goal is to have them intiate unprompted conversations with you (the player), and ultimatley acheive the most real-feeling simulation possible.

Project Machina is a sort of sequel to Project Lambda, in which we built an AI with behvaioural cloning that can naviagate a space.
